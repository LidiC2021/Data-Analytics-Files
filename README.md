I have based my research on data from World Health Organization(WHO).
WHO Data Resource
I investigated and found patterns and trends for countries in various locations across the World.
Analysing 2904 rows of data, I saw patterns of Life expectancy and Healthy Life expectancy at birth (HALE) throughout the whole regions.
"Life expectancy" refers to the number of years a person can expect to live. 
It is an important way of assessing the health of a population and is used to inform health policy and initiatives that impact everyday life.
"Life expectancy at birth" is the average number of years that a newborn could expect to live, while "Healthy life expectancy (HALE) at birth" is the average number of years that a person could expect to live in "full health" from birth. This measurement takes into account years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury.
